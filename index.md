# Research Interests & Experience
## Current: 
**BESIII, CGEM, Undergraduate thesis, Jilin University & IHEP.** (*Advisor: Prof. Weimin Song, Prof. Liangliang Wang, Prof. Linghui Wu, Prof. Gang Li*)  
Improvement for sampling efficiency for avalanche electrons in CGEM for BESIII. 
## Previous:
### Experimental
**NEXT Experiment (0vββ), Visiting Research Fellow at Harvard University.** (*Advisor: Prof. Roxanne Guenette*)  
Update of NEXT-100 detector:  
+ Perform reflectance measurement for different PTFE to increase capacity of photon gathering in NEXT-100.  
+ Set up an evaporation chamber to coat the PTFE with wavelength shifer.  
+ Investigate the performence of matelen array put in front of Silicon PMs: Simulate the performance and calculate the efficiency.  

**T2K Experiment, Visiting Student at Stony Brook University.** (*Advisor: Prof. Michael Wilking*)  
Event simulation and reconstruction:  
+ Simulate events of weak interaction in superK with SKDETSIM.  
+ Reconstruct the events by FiTQun with 3D & 6D light scattering tables and compare the reconstrction qualities.  
+ Investigate non-purturbative process for muon events.  
+ Apply BDT to event reconstruction.
### Theoretical
#### Research:
**Neutrinos & Yang-Mills solitons** (*Advisor: Prof. Haijun Wang, Jilin University*)  
+ See-saw mechanism.  
+ Soliton solutions for Yang-Mills fields, especially Witten & BPS monopoles. Investigate properties of angular momentum for these monopoles and generalize them to gauge fields. Explain the results from gauge fixing and string perspectives.  
#### Projects & course work:
+ Matter effects for sterile neutrinos in MiniBooNE. (*Instructor: Prof. Michael Wilking, Stony Brook University*)  
+ Topological strings, Amplitude calculation for string phenomenology & compatification, AdS-CFT correspondence. (*Instructor: Prof. Warren Siegel, YITP, Stony Brook University*)
